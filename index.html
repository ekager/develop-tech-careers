            Great! We could use you! If you're here you probably already know the benefits of working in tech, but here
            are the reasons I am in tech!
            <ul>
                <li>It's fun! I like being creative in my work and coding gives me an outlet to learn every day and
                    create something new
                    every week!
                </li>
                <li>The benefits are unreal. Snacks on snacks on snacks in the office plus you know, the benefits that
                    matter, like PTO policies, flexible schedules, and 401k matching.

            So the first step will be to power up and learn some skills. There are some options here.
                You can go to a bootcamp, a change career program at a college or university, ad hoc classes at a local
                college, not to mention self studying with a plethora of print and online resouces. So how do you
                choose? Each has their pros and cons.
            <table style="padding: 16px">
                <tr>
                    <th>Method</th>
                    <th>Pros</th>
                    <th>Cons</th>
                </tr>

                    <td>Cheapest</td>
                    <td>No Guidance or Recruiting Help</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Bootcamp</td>
                    <td>Cost and Time Effective<br>Includes Recruiting Help</td>

            <p class="mb-5">Now that we've gone through the pros and cons, I can give some recommendations for programs
                and courses that I've heard of. Definitely not an exhaustive list but maybe a good place to start!</p>

            <h2 class="mb-5">Git Some Projects</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Alright, learning data structures is great and all, but when are we going to ACTUALLY MAKE
                SOMETHING. This is how I felt my whole first year of coding. Sorting lists, greedy algorithms, and data
                structures don't seem like anything software engineers actually do...<br>
                These things are the foundations that will get you to thinking like a programmer though! But let's get
                to the actual projects which you will need to have to find any developer job.<br>
                You can make anything your heart desires, but here are some examples to start with!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your personal website! Definitely recommended as a must do. Great news is there are SO many
                    tutorials online that you'll have a website up and running in no time. Check out the <a href="#hints">hints and tricks</a>
                    section for some tips!
                </li>
                <li>A mobile app that is either a clone of an app you like or something simple like a notes app.</li>
                <li>An add-on/extension for a website</li>
                <li>Make a game</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-5">Make sure whatever projects you're building that you are putting the code on Github or
                another code sharing platform so that you can link to it on job applications!
                If you have no idea where to start, that's okay.
                There are plenty of tutorials where you can follow along and learn and build something,
                and then build something similar yourself!
                Don't reinvent the wheel and don't feel bad using templates or starting points on Github.</p>

                            The official definition is "Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer
                            files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people."
                            Another way to say this is git helps you keep track of different versions of your project.
                            Say you and I start a project and are both working on it.
                            We would need one copy that is the official copy. Then we could each have a copy of the
                            official copy (a fork) created by cloning the official copy that we need to keep updated
                            with the official while we work.
                            When we want to make some changes, we will create a new branch to work with.

                            Most people I talk to who are software engineers didn't necessarily choose a speciality.
                            Everyone learns the basics and maybe you do one project where you find out that you really
                            like
                            front end web development, so you then take your experience and apply to jobs in that field.
                            A lot of junior software engineering positions that you apply for won't even necessarily
                            tell
                            you what you'll be working on until you start, so someone will choose for you. It's good in
                            tech to be able to adapt quickly to work on something totally new, because technology is
                            changing
                            all of the time. Knowing Java or Python may not be relevant in 5, 10, or 15 years, just like
                            mobile app development wasn't a thing 10 or 15 years ago. Learning the basics well and working on a
                            range of projects will prepare you to be constantly learning.

            <p>I graduated as a neuroscience major and transitioned into tech 2 years post
                graduation. I now work as a mobile developer at Mozilla.<br>
                I created this website because it was difficult to find answers to the simplest questions about tech and
                I want to share information and resources.<br>
